            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>At IPREU Digital, we understand that health data is among the most sensitive information you possess.
                FeminaFlow
                is built with a "zero-leak" philosophy. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your
                privacy and managing your data securely.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> FeminaFlow allows you to track cycles, symptoms, moods, and other
                health-related data. 100% of this data is stored exclusively on your device's local storage.</p>
            <p><strong>No Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> We do not require you to create an
                account, provide your name, email address, or any other identifying information to use the app.</p>

            <h2>3. How Your Information is Used</h2>
            <p>Your data is used solely to provide tracking and visualization services within the FeminaFlow app on your
                device. We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purpose.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Since your information is stored locally, its security depends on your device's security. We recommend
                using device-level encryption and biometric locks (Fingerprint/FaceID), which FeminaFlow supports to
                protect your logs from unauthorized access.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>You have full control over your data. You can delete individual entries or all data at any time through
                the app settings. Uninstalling the app will also permanently delete all locally stored data on your
                device.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>FeminaFlow does not share or sell your data to insurance companies, advertisers, or any third parties. We
                do not use third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>FeminaFlow is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any
                information from children.</p>

            <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
            <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page
                with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
