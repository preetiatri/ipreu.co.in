            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>StudySnap is an AI-powered educational assistant developed as part of the IPREU suite. This Privacy
                Policy explains our dual-layer approach to data processing, combining local power with global
                intelligence.</p>

            <h2>2. Information Processing Layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Local OCR Layer:</strong> Text extraction from your photos and PDFs happens directly on your
                device using on-device vision libraries. This data is processed in real-time and remains under your
                control.</p>
            <p><strong>AI Interaction Layer:</strong> When you ask questions, queries are sent to the Google Gemini API
                to generate helpful responses. This data is used solely for generating responses and is not retained on
                IPREU servers.</p>

            <h2>3. Information Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>Account-Free Usage:</strong> StudySnap does not require account creation, email addresses, or any
                personal identifying information.</p>
            <p><strong>Local History:</strong> Your chat history and processed documents are stored locally on your
                device for your convenience and are not synced to our servers.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
            <p>We leverage industry-leading services to provide StudySnap's intelligence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> For natural language processing and question answering.</li>
                <li><strong>Google ML Kit:</strong> For high-performance on-device text recognition.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Data sent to these services is governed by their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing
                Google's Privacy Policy for more detail.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>You have total control over your academic data. You can clear your chat history or delete processed files
                within the app settings. Deleting the app will remove all local data associated with StudySnap.</p>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>StudySnap is designed for students. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under
                13 without appropriate parental consent context as defined by applicable laws.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>Any updates to this policy will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.</p>
